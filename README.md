# Real-Time-Video-Object-Detection-Using-Tiny-YOLOv2-in-MATLAB
 This project implements real-time object detection in videos using MATLAB's Tiny YOLOv2 model. It processes each frame of a video, detects objects, and annotates them with bounding boxes, labels, and confidence scores. The project demonstrates efficient real-time video analysis and visualization.
